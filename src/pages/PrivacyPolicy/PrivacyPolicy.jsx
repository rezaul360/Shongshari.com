        <h4 className='privacy-title'>Security</h4>
        <p className='privacy-description'>This site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.</p>

        <p className='privacy-description'>While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. To learn more about SSL, follow this link Verisign While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.</p>

        <p className='privacy-description'>All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies, are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to info@taslimamarriagemedia.com.

        <p className='privacy-description'>Email Messages, Registration Forms, and other related forms. We make the contents of the registration form visible to you and other registered members of the marriage bureau. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. For this website to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, we must supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.</p>

        <p className='privacy-description'>For example, to determine if our customers qualify for one of our credit cards, we use their names and social security numbers to request a credit report. Once we determine a user’s credit worthiness, this document is destroyed. (or) For this website to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual’s preference, we combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our partners, Company Y & Company Z, to create a personalized user profile. When a user purchases either of these two companies, the companies collect and share that purchase information with us so we can tailor the site to our users’ preferences.</p>
